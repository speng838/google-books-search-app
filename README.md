# Google Books Search
Google Books Search is a app that uses react to search for books on google. When entering the topic or title of a book in the search bar, the site will bring up a list of novels. 

In the display section, where a certain novel is shown, the "view more" button will open up a new window where the novel can be bought. In the same section, if the "save book" button is pressed, the book will be saved on the website for later viewing.

The following is the link to this site deployed on heroku:
